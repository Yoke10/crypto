Here’s a simplified algorithm to create a basic car auction network using Hyperledger Fabric, IBM Blockchain Starter Plan, and Node.js.

### Step 1: Set Up the Hyperledger Fabric Network
1. *Provision Network*:
   - Use IBM Blockchain Starter Plan to set up the network following IBM’s setup guide.
2. *Create a Channel*:
   - Create a channel (e.g., mychannel) for transactions.
3. *Add Peers*:
   - Add peers to the channel as per IBM's instructions.

### Step 2: Define and Deploy Chaincode for Car Auction
1. *Write Chaincode*:
   - Define a CarAuctionContract with three main functions:
     - CreateAuction: Starts an auction for a car.
     - PlaceBid: Places a bid on the auction if it’s the highest.
     - GetAuction: Retrieves the auction details.
2. *Deploy Chaincode*:
   - Deploy this contract onto the network using IBM's interface.

### Step 3: Create a Node.js Application to Interact with Chaincode
1. *Set Up SDK*:
   - Use the fabric-network SDK to connect to the network.
2. *Connect to Channel and Contract*:
   - Load the user identity from the wallet, connect to mychannel, and get the carAuction contract.

### Step 4: Implement Auction Functions
1. *Create Auction*:
   - Write a function to call CreateAuction on the contract to start an auction.
2. *Place Bid*:
   - Write a function to call PlaceBid to submit a new bid if it’s the highest.
3. *Get Auction*:
   - Write a function to call GetAuction to retrieve auction details.

### Summary
1. Set up the network on IBM Blockchain Starter Plan.
2. Write and deploy car auction chaincode.
3. Create a Node.js app to connect to the network.
4. Implement basic functions to:
   - Start an auction.
   - Place a bid.
   - Get auction details.

This algorithm gives you a simple structure to follow for setting up a car auction network on Hyperledger Fabric.
