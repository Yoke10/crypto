Algorithm for Asset Transfer Application

1. *Setup Environment*
   - Install dependencies.
   - Set up Hyperledger Fabric test network.
   - Deploy the chaincode (smart contract) on the network.

2. *Initialize Ledger*
   - Call the InitLedger function to populate the ledger with initial asset data (e.g., asset1, asset2, asset3, etc.).
     - Create an array of assets with attributes like ID, Color, Size, Owner, AppraisedValue.
     - Loop through each asset and use putState() to save each asset on the ledger.

3. *Create Wallet and Admin Credentials*
   - Set up a wallet to store user credentials.
   - Enroll the admin user with the Certificate Authority (CA).
   - Store the admin credentials in the wallet.

4. *Register and Enroll Application User*
   - Register and enroll the application user using admin credentials.
   - Store the user credentials in the wallet.

5. *Connect to Blockchain Network*
   - Create a Gateway instance to connect the application to the Fabric network.
   - Get reference to the contract deployed on the specified channel.

6. *Submit Transactions*
   - Use the submitTransaction() API to invoke chaincode functions such as InitLedger, CreateAsset, ReadAsset, UpdateAsset.
     - Each function interacts with the ledger, performing actions like adding new assets, querying assets, or updating existing assets.

7. *Query the Ledger*
   - Use evaluateTransaction() to query the ledger for assets.
     - Example: Use GetAllAssets to retrieve all assets or ReadAsset to get details of a single asset based on its ID.

8. *Output Results*
   - After invoking a transaction, capture and display the results (e.g., asset details, success confirmation).

9. *Terminate the Network*
   - Once all operations are done, bring down the test network using the network.sh script.
