The steps outlined here walk you through setting up a Hyperledger Fabric network, creating a business network using Hyperledger Composer, and integrating a front-end application for interacting with the network. Here's a breakdown:

### 1. *Installing Prerequisites and Tools*
   - Install required tools like *Docker Engine, **Node.js, **Git, and **Python 2.7.x*.
   - Use Hyperledger's bash script to ease the installation process.
   - Install additional development tools using npm, but avoid using sudo for npm commands.

### 2. *Setting Up Hyperledger Fabric Runtime*
   - Create a new directory and download Hyperledger Fabric tools.
   - Specify the Fabric version (e.g., hlfv12).
   - Start the local Fabric network using startFabric.sh, and stop it with stopFabric.sh.

### 3. *Creating and Deploying the Business Network*
   - Generate a business network with *yo hyperledger-composer*. Name it, e.g., cards-trading-network.
   - *Modeling*: Define asset types (like TradingCard), participant types (like Trader), transactions (e.g., TradeCard), and events (e.g., TradeNotification).
     - Use a .cto file for the model and define relationships using --> for referencing participants.
   - *Logic*: Create a lib directory with a logic.js file to define transaction logic (e.g., for trading cards).
   - *Permissions*: Set access rules for participants in the permissions.acl file.
   - *Create a Business Network Archive (BNA)*: Run composer archive create to package your business network into a .bna file.
   - *Install and Deploy*: Use composer network install and composer network start commands to deploy the network on your local Fabric runtime.

### 4. *Testing the Business Network*
   - Use *Composer Playground* (composer-playground) to interact with your business network.
   - Create participants (e.g., Trader) and assets (e.g., TradingCard).
   - Use the *Test page* to execute transactions (e.g., trading cards) between participants.
   - *Ping* the network to confirm everything is working: composer network ping --card admin@cards-trading-network.

### 5. *Creating a REST API Server*
   - Use composer-rest-server to expose your business network as a REST API. This allows client applications to interact with the network.
   - Access the API at http://localhost:3000/explorer.

### 6. *Generating an Angular Application*
   - Use *yo hyperledger-composer* to create an Angular application that connects to the business network via the REST API.
   - Once generated, run npm start to load the app in the browser (http://localhost:4200/).

### 7. *Enhancing the Front-End*
   - Modify the Angular application to add modal windows for initiating transactions (e.g., trading cards).
   - Add necessary fields in the modal for users to provide input and trigger transactions, such as the card owner and trade details.
   - Remove unnecessary fields that are auto-generated by the network (like transaction ID and timestamp).

### 8. *Further Customization*
   - You can extend the application by adding features like setting card prices, managing trader balances, and adding more transactions.
   - Integrate the blockchain network with non-blockchain applications for enhanced functionality, such as enabling card purchases that update the user's collection.

By following these steps, you will have successfully created, deployed, and interacted with a blockchain-based business network using Hyperledger Fabric and Composer, integrated with an Angular front-end application for seamless user interaction.
