Hereâ€™s a simpler version of the process to set up a Hyperledger Fabric network, define a rewards smart contract, create a frontend, and connect it to the network.

### Step 1: Set Up Hyperledger Fabric Network
1. *Install Required Tools*: Install Docker, Docker Compose, and Hyperledger Fabric binaries.
2. *Set Up Network*: Use the Hyperledger Fabric sample network or follow the setup guide to create your own network.
3. *Start the Network*: Run Docker containers to start the peers and orderers.

### Step 2: Create Rewards Smart Contract
1. *Define Contract*: Write a Go contract for managing rewards.
   - Define IssueReward to store reward points for a member.
   - Define GetReward to retrieve reward points for a member.
2. *Deploy Contract*: Install and instantiate the contract on the Fabric network.

### Step 3: Develop a Simple Web Frontend
1. *Set Up React App*: Create a React app with input fields for memberID and points.
2. *Define Actions*: Add buttons to issue and retrieve rewards.

### Step 4: Connect Frontend to Hyperledger Fabric
1. *Use fabric-network SDK*: Set up the fabric-network library to connect to the Fabric network.
2. *Create Contract Functions*:
   - Implement issueReward and getReward functions to call the smart contract.
3. *Integrate with Frontend*: Connect the React component with the backend functions to issue and retrieve rewards.

### Summary
1. Set up the Fabric network.
2. Write and deploy the rewards smart contract.
3. Build a React frontend to manage rewards.
4. Connect the frontend to the Fabric network.
