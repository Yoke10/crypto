Bitcoin Merkle Tree Construction Algorithm

#### Step 1: Split Transactions into Pairs
1. Input: A list of transaction IDs (txids) in the block.
2. Action: Pair the transaction IDs. If the total number of transactions is odd, duplicate the last txid to make it even.
   
   Example:
   
   Transactions: [tx1, tx2, tx3, tx4]
   After pairing: [(tx1, tx2), (tx3, tx4)]
   

#### Step 2: Byte-swap the txids
1. Input: Transaction ID pairs from Step 1.
2. Action: Swap the bytes of each txid in the pair. This step ensures the byte-order of txids is consistent, as Bitcoin uses little-endian format.

   Example:
   
   Before swap: (tx1, tx2)
   After byte-swap: (tx1_swapped, tx2_swapped)
   

#### Step 3: Concatenate the txids
1. Input: Byte-swapped txid pairs from Step 2.
2. Action: Concatenate each pair of txids into a single string or byte sequence.
   
   Example:
   
   Concatenate tx1_swapped and tx2_swapped to get: tx1_swapped + tx2_swapped
   Concatenate tx3_swapped and tx4_swapped to get: tx3_swapped + tx4_swapped
   

#### Step 4: Double hash the concatenated pairs
1. Input: Concatenated txid pairs from Step 3.
2. Action: Apply the hash function twice (e.g., SHA-256) to the concatenated txid string for each pair. The double hashing step ensures security.
   
   Example:
   
   Hash1 = SHA256(tx1_swapped + tx2_swapped)
   Hash2 = SHA256(tx3_swapped + tx4_swapped)
   Hash1, Hash2 are the new hashes for these pairs.
   

#### Step 5: Repeat the Process Until One Hash Remains
1. Input: The resulting hashes from Step 4.
2. Action: Treat these hashes as new transaction IDs, and repeat the steps of pairing, byte-swapping, concatenating, and double hashing, until only one hash remains, which is the root of the Merkle tree.

### Detailed Bitcoin Merkle Tree Algorithm

1. Initialize: 
   - Take a list of all txids in the block (transactions in the block).

2. Pairing:
   - Split the txids into pairs (if the number of txids is odd, duplicate the last txid).

3. Byte-Swap:
   - Byte-swap each txid in every pair to ensure little-endian format.

4. Concatenate:
   - Concatenate the byte-swapped txids in each pair into a single string.

5. Double Hash:
   - Apply SHA256 hash to each concatenated string to obtain a new hash.

6. Repeat:
   - Take the new hashes from the double hashing step as txids for the next round.
   - Repeat Steps 2 to 5 with the new txids until you are left with a single hash (the Merkle root).

7. Output:
   - The final remaining hash is the Merkle root for the block.

### Example:

Letâ€™s say we have four txids:  
[tx1, tx2, tx3, tx4]

1. Pair:  
   [(tx1, tx2), (tx3, tx4)]

2. Byte-Swap:  
   [(tx1_swapped, tx2_swapped), (tx3_swapped, tx4_swapped)]

3. Concatenate:  
   tx1_swapped + tx2_swapped  
   tx3_swapped + tx4_swapped

4. Double Hash:  
   Hash1 = SHA256(tx1_swapped + tx2_swapped)  
   Hash2 = SHA256(tx3_swapped + tx4_swapped)

5. New Round (now repeat with Hash1 and Hash2):
   - Pair Hash1 and Hash2.
   - Byte-swap, concatenate, and double hash again.
   - Repeat this until you have only one final hash, which will be the Merkle root.

This root hash represents the Merkle tree and is included in the block header to ensure integrity of all transactions within that block.
